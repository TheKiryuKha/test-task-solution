# thekiryukha laravel template
An ultra-strict, type-safe Laravel skeleton engineered for developers who refuse to compromise on code quality. This opinionated starter kit enforces rigorous development standards through meticulous tooling configuration and architectural decisions that prioritize type safety, immutability, and fail-fast principles.

## What is in the box

* 100% Type Coverage: Every method, property, and parameter is explicitly typed
* Zero Tolerance for Code Smells: Rector and PHPStan at maximum strictness catch issues before they become bugs
* Immutable-First Architecture: Data structures favor immutability to prevent unexpected mutations
* Fail-Fast Philosophy: Errors are caught at compile-time, not runtime
* Automated Code Quality: Pre-configured tools ensure consistent, pristine code across your entire team
* Just Better Laravel Defaults: Thanks to strict models, auto eager loading, immutable dates, and more...

## Installation guide
Just run the following command in your terminal:

```
composer create-project thekiryukha/laravel your_app_name
```
